# PSWebProxy

## Summary

PsWebProxy is a web proxy capable of forwarding/dropping packets captured using raw PowerShell sockets.

## Default Options

The default options are set to listen on port 1080 and redirect "captured" data to port 9080 

(I plan on writing up an options function that globally sets the options for the listening socket and the client socket in the near future)
